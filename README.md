As a suggestion, to run the algorithm, please load the htn.lisp file first on SLIME with the following code snippet.

(load "./your/path/to/file/htn.lisp")
```
After loading the file, you are ready to run our program with the following command.
```lisp

```
The program will ask for domain.hddl and problem.hddl as follows. Please enter your domain and problem file in the form of HDDL structure.
